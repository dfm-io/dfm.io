First, if you're used to using [emcee](http://dfm.io/emcee) for your MCMC needs, you'll find that it's pretty hard to implement a model with discrete variables so you'd probably need to learn some [other](http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc/) [sampler](http://mc-stan.org/) and, honestly, it probably wouldn't work well for this problem either! Which brings us to our second problem. This problem is *very* high dimensional and the dimension scales with the number of data points. Without the outlier model, the problem is only two-dimensional but when we include the outliers, the model suddenly becomes $(4 + K)$-dimensional, where $K$ is the number of data points.

In the figure below, darker points are more likely to be drawn from the line. This plot is pretty satisfying because the model has done a good job labeling all but one outlier at high confidence!"
