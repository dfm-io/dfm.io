    "**Warning** *this is an extremely technical blog post (even for me) but I think that it's an interesting experiment so I thought I would post it anyways!*\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Kepler* Mission has been a great success story for open science. The recent data releases have been on a fast and regular schedule and the data products are sometimes made public before the science office publishes their papers. Therefore, when the most recent installment in the \"rate of Earths\" saga—a discussion [close to my heart](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3020)—hit the ArXiv as [Burke et al. (2015)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04175), I decided to see if I could reproduce their results by following the steps described in their paper. Crazy, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post, I'll go through the steps to reproduce most of their key results as an experiment in *Open Science*. [*Spoiler alert: I dont get exactly the same results but I do come to the same conclusions...*]\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also worth noting that Burke also posted code and results to supplement the paper: [christopherburke/KeplerPORTs](https://github.com/christopherburke/KeplerPORTs).\n",

    "\n",
    "## The science case\n",
    "\n",
    "While the point of this post isn't to discuss the physical implications of this result, it is worth taking a moment to motivate this experiment. One of the key areas of research in exoplanets is (what I like to call) *population inference*; determining the underlying occurrence rate and distribution of exoplanets and their physical properties. This is interesting as a data science problem because we now have large catalogs of exoplanet discoveries and characterizations and it's interesting scientifically because it is the best shot we have of connecting exoplanet observations to theories of the formation and evolution of exoplanet systems. It also places a constraint on the frequency of planets like Earth and planetary systems like our Solar system (Are we alone? and all that...).\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been a huge amount of research in this field but [Burke et al. (2015)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04175) present (arguably) the most careful treatment of the systematic effects based on a characterization of the official *Kepler* pipeline. Even before submission, the data products describing this characterization were all publicly available on the [Exoplanet Archive](http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic data analysis question that we're trying to answer here is: given an incomplete catalog of planet parameters (smaller planets on longer periods are harder to find), what can we say about the underlying distribution of properties? For this model, we'll use the Poisson process likelihood to compute the probability of a set of measurements (e.g. orbital period, planet radius, etc.) $w_k = (P_k,\\,R_k)$, given a parametric model for the underlying \"occurrence rate\" $\\Gamma_\\theta(w)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(\\{w_k\\}\\,|\\,\\theta) = \\exp \\left(\\int Q(w)\\,\\Gamma_\\theta(w)\\,\\mathrm{d}w\\right) \\, \\prod_{k=1}^K Q(w_k)\\,\\Gamma_\\theta(w_k)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Q(w)$ is an estimate of the (mean) detection efficiency (or completeness) as a function of the parameters $w$. Then, we just need to optimize for $\\theta$ or choose a prior $p(\\theta)$ and sample using MCMC. Like Burke et al., we'll build our model in orbital period (in days) and planet radius (in Earth radii) and use a product of independent power laws in the two dimensions for $\\Gamma_\\theta (w) = \\Gamma_\\theta (P)\\,\\Gamma_\\theta (R)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The data\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, let's download (and cache) the dataset from the Exoplanet Archive. Don't worry about the details of these functions but what they do is download the csv tables (`q1_q16_stellar` and `q1_q16_koi`) and save them as a pandas block."
