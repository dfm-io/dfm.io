I'm an Associate Research Scientist at the [Flatiron
Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/)'s [Center for
Computational
Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/).
My main research interest is the application of probabilistic data analysis
techniques to solve fundamental problems in astronomy. These days, I'm mostly
using time domain surveys to discover new exoplanets, interpret the underlying
population of these planets, and learn more about the variability of stars. I am
also interested in the development of scientific software and open-source
practices.
